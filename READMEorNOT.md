# BaconSite
The site made during my first hackathon with BakerBran89. We created to this to build in attempt to build something during our
first hackathon. We had no where to start nor what to do. We ran into a .club domain developer at his booth in the event. He gave us an idea where we could win a cash prize for most interesting .club site name. We then went off with that and started collaborating. Thus, www.baconsandwich.club was born. Note this was also our very first site published and first ever adventure into the web world. 

# The Ideas We Wanted
We wanted to have implement a little real-time game where the users from different ends of the page can click on a button where it will stack bacon up to a certain amount up until any one of the users decided to finish the sandwich by clicking on the end sandwich button. It would show how many times the user has clicked it, how many unique users have helped stack the bacon, and how long it took to stack the bacon.

# What Really Happened
Because this was our first implementation of a site, we realized that the time alloted wouldn't be on our side to finish adding the features we had hoped. So instead we just we would cycle through an array of bacon images such that the first index is the lowest amount of back up to the last index, which is the largest amount.

# Outcome Of This
I realized this was a cool project in the end and we ended up learning a lot. We found out we are total noobs and will come back again to learn more.
